# ∞ Infinite Terminal - 无限终端

A VS Code extension that provides an **infinite canvas** for managing multiple terminals, with real terminal I/O, git worktree integration, and a unique **pixel art office view**.

## Features

### 🖥️ Infinite Canvas with Real Terminals
- Create unlimited terminals on an infinite, pannable canvas
- **Real terminal I/O via node-pty** — full ANSI color support, interactive programs work
- Drag, resize, and reposition terminals freely
- Zoom in/out with mouse wheel (zoom toward cursor)
- Grid background for spatial orientation
- **Keyboard input directly in terminal cards** — arrow keys, Ctrl+C, tab completion all work

### 🔍 Terminal Search (Ctrl+P)
- Quick-search terminals by name
- Arrow keys to navigate results, Enter to jump
- Instantly pans canvas and focuses the selected terminal
- Each terminal has an editable name (double-click to rename)

### 🚀 Preset Management
- Quick-launch from dock: Shell, Node.js, Python, Vim
- **Full preset manager UI** — add, edit, delete presets
- Presets saved to VS Code settings
- One-click custom terminal creation

### 🌿 Git Worktree Integration
- Create git worktrees for parallel branch development
- **Worktree manager UI** — list, open, and delete worktrees
- Each worktree terminal auto-links with connection lines

### 🗺️ Minimap
- Appears during canvas/terminal drag
- Shows all terminals as miniature rectangles
- Highlights viewport and focused terminal
- Auto-hides 1.5s after drag stops

### 📐 Connection Lines
- Dashed lines connect related terminals (parent ↔ child)
- Worktree terminals auto-link to their origin
- Lines update in real-time during drag

### 💾 Layout Persistence
- Terminal positions, sizes, and canvas view auto-saved
- Restored on next session open
- Saves to VS Code workspace state

### 🏢 Pixel Office View
- Toggle pixel art office scene
- **Each terminal = one pixel worker** (auto-created)
- Workers have randomized appearance (8 hair colors, 8 shirt colors)
- **Status linked to real terminal activity:**
  - Active terminal → worker typing at desk
  - Idle terminal → worker takes coffee break
  - Exited terminal → worker shows 💀
- Autonomous behaviors: walking, stretching, thinking
- Speech bubbles: "Working...", "Compiling...", "☕ Coffee time", "Done! ✓"
